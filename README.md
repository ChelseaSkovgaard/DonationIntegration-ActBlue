# Donation Integration - ActBlue for WordPress

This is example code to build a donation module with PHP in WordPress. Using a client's link from Act Blue, this module allows 
to carry that amount into the url. When clicking submit, the donation amount is then preselected for the visitor leading to
higher conversions.
